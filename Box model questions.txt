BOX MODEL QUESTIONS

Experiments:
- What OH do I need to match MCF with no MCF emission changes? And what does this do to CH4 emissions?
- What OH do I need to match CH4 with no CH4 emission changes? And what does this do to MCF emissions?
	METHOD: Set MCF emission prior error very low, and OH and CH4 error high
- What results do I get when I do not optimize CH4? MCF? OH? d13C?
	METHOD: Low prior errors in the quantity of interest, and high observational errors
- If I use the same OH (eg constant) for NOAA and AGAGE CH4, do I still get such different emissions?

Interpretation:
- How well can I explain the year-to-year variations in CH4 emissions?
- What does the d13C signature of the CH4 emissions tell me exactly?
- Where do the differences between my results and literature (montzka/rigby) come from?
- How is it that when I decrease the correlation length, CH4 emissions get very noisy, but the match with the
	observations does not become "overfittingly" well?

Box model settings:
- How should I set the correlation lengths of OH and CH4? If short, more noisy but maybe more information?
- How important is it that I get a good chi-squared during my experiments (except when explicitly overfitting)?
- How should I set the different prior errors? This seems to me actually a very arbitrary, and result-oriented procedure.

	By tuning the prior errors such and such I can make my model say exactly what I want it to say...

- Should I make the errors in fst,fsl,fme different? Mccullogh and Midgley seem to indicate that shifts from rapid to
	stockpiling is less likely than shifts between the other 3.
